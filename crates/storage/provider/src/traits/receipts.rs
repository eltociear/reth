/// Resolving tags requires keeping track of block hashes or block numbers associated with the tag,
/// so this trait can only be implemented for types that implement `BlockIdProvider`. The
/// `BlockIdProvider` methods should be used to resolve `BlockId`s to block numbers or hashes, and
/// retrieving the receipts should be done using the type's `ReceiptProvider` methods.
